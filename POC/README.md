Adding Files to Proof-of-Concept (POC) Directory
================================================

1. Please follow the naming convention: for each POC subcategory, make a new directory named with one lowercase word describing the subcategory.

2. Do not duplicate code or put extraneous files in any subcategory directory - DRY code only!
