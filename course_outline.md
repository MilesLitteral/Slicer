## Course Outline

### Description
_Interdisciplinary Team Project II_ is an advanced course in the Emerging Media Technology program that provides an opportunity for students to apply the skills they've acquired in the course of pursuing their degree to an collaboratively designed and implemented project suitable for deployment in the real world.

### Project Development 
Students will assess their collective skills and develop ideas for a number of candidate projects that leverage their skills. With the help of the professor, candidate projects will be evaluated.  Projects must be within budget, using the materials readily available within the Entertainment Technology department; projects must be sufficiently ambitious, but not so ambitious that they cannot be accomplished within one semester; projects must leverage the existing skills of the students in the class, and provide opportunities for participation by everyone -- this does not, however, mean that unfamiliar technologies _must_ be excluded.

Once candidate projects are selected, they will be winnowed by absolute veto -- that is, anyone in the class has the abilty to veto any project without contest. This ensures that no one is forced to work on a project in which they have little interest. If the winnowing process removes all proposed projects, another brainstorming session takes place. After a winnowing process, if more than one project remains, each person votes for his/her favorite. The professor reserves the right to break a tie that may occur at this point.

### Scheduling
Every two weeks a new benchmark will be established by the students, in consultation with the professor. The benchmark represents a subset of goals for the overarching project that must be accomplished within the two-week "sprint." All project participants will have tasks during the sprint. GitHub will be used to manage software, design, and documentation verisioning for the project. Each participant will push completed work to their own copy of the development branch and open a PR (pull request). A "landmaster," typically one of the more experienced coders in the class, will evaluate the pull request. The professor will also evaluate the pull request. Both will provide comments requesting changes, if needed, and the committer will be required to fix and push to his/her remote copy of the branch until the work is considered complete. Each day we will have a brief standup meeting to determine where we are, individually and as a group.

### Grading
Grading will be based on the quality of work received from each student at each benchmark. For example, if the landmaster and the professor approve a student's work for merge immediately, an 'A+' is awarded. If the work is not complete, the grade will fall one letter grade (i.e. B -> B-) for each additional PRs required to fix it. If the work is not completed by the next benchmark, an 'F' is assigned for that task.
